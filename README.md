# A Predictive Diagnosis Assistant in an Electronic Medical Records Platform

## Summary
The Predictive Diagnosis Assistant is designed to expedite and streamline doctors’ diagnostic process. This project aims to develop a platform where symptoms entered from patient records are used to predict possible diseases or conditions which will provide a starting point for healthcare providers to make a comprehensive review of the patient’s symptoms.
The main dataset to be utilized comprises diagnoses, symptoms and patient records. Our approach involves training and testing multinomial classification models to predict possible diseases based on entered symptoms, integrate the best-performing model into an Electronic Medical Records (EMR) platform that will be hosted on a cloud server. 
Ultimately, the overarching goal is to enhance patient care. By providing doctors with a tool that accelerates the diagnostic process, offers data-backed insights and data-driven decisions, the project contributes to better patient outcomes, faster treatment and improved services.
